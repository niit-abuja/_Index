# _Index
This document lists ideas and projects NIIT Abuja students may work on. This list should be regularly updated to reflect current trends.

## Software Development

#### Campus Technologies Limited Open Source License (CTL-OSL)

While not an app, this is still an important idea.  
CTL-OSL should be the default license applied to projects in this account. A good existing license to base this on is 
The Code Project Open License ([CPOL](https://www.codeproject.com/info/CPOL.zip)).

#### Flowchart App

Flowchart is taught to beginners at NIIT. It would be good to have an app to help them visualize the concepts being taught.

#### Pseudocode App

Similar to the Flowchart app mentioned above, but for pseudocode.

#### UI kits

Create UI Kits for various platforms, although emphasis should be given to web.

#### Developers Network

Create a website that connects developers, especially those that attended NIIT.
