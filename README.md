This is the official Github account for NIIT Abuja. Students are expected to submit projects here, as well as extend existing projects.  

The process of submitting a project here involves two steps:  
* Creating a repository in your personal Github account.
* Informing an administrator of this NIIT account of the existence of the afore-mentioned repository so that it can be forked in this NIIT account.

Your repository should have the appropriate LICENSE applied to it. Note that, where necessary, the LICENSE in the forked (NIIT) repository may be different from that in the original repository. This will be done to enable easy sharing of source code and other resources amongst students.
